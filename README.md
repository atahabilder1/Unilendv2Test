# Unilend V2
UniLend Protocol is a permissionless decentralized money market protocol with lending and
borrowing service through smart contracts.

UniLend enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by supplying collateral to the network
that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a
secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually
(APY) paid per block while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed.

This document highlights the latest version of our protocol, UniLend V2, which brings the
dual asset pools for lending borrowing with price feed oracles and gas optimization.
UniLend v2 is implemented as an entirely new set of contracts, available here. The UniLend
v2 core contracts are partly upgradeable with some parameters controlled by governance.
